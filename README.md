# Spring Boot 3 & JWT Authentication

This repository represents the implementation of JWT authentication with Spring Security and OAuth2 Resource Server, as described in the upcoming article titled **"Spring Boot 3 & JWT Authentication: Leveraging Spring Security’s Built-in Support"**. 

The article (once published) will provide detailed documentation and instructions for setting up and testing the project. For now, this repository contains a simple demo of the authentication process, including how to generate and validate JWT tokens. Stay tuned for the full article with step-by-step guidance.

## Branches

This repository provides two approaches to JWT authentication:

- `main` – Implements JWT authentication using a symmetric key (HMAC).
- `asymmetric-key` – Implements JWT authentication using an asymmetric key (RSA).
